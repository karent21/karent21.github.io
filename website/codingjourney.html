        <p>My coding journey began with the Girls Who Code summer program, where I discovered my passion for technology and creativity. During the program, I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and applied these skills to build interactive websites on Replit. Two of my favorite projects were a personal website about Emma Watson, showcasing both design and research skills, and a personality quiz that used logic and user input to deliver fun, customized results. These experiences sparked my interest in web development and taught me how coding can be a powerful tool for storytelling and self-expression.</p>
